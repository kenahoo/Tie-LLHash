      - Added 'lazy-mode', which allows you to append new entries to the end
        of the hash by assigning to the hash by doing $hash{key} = 'value';
   
   0.03
      - fixed a fatal bug in the current_value() method
      - insert(key,value) now equivalent to first(key,value),
        making it somewhat easier to insert values at the beginning
        of the hash.
      - wrote documentation for the non-TIEHASH methods
   
   0.02  Wed May 20 19:21:52 1998
      - forgot to include a README file in the original distribution, so I
        added one now
      - running all tests now won't give any warnings under -w flag
      - added tests 7-10
      - fixed some problems with the DELETE method - it went wrong when
        deleting the last element in a hash
      - insert() didn't work right when inserting after the last element
      - can give initialization hash for tie() constructor
   
   0.01  Mon May 11 17:45:43 1998
      - original version; created by h2xs 1.18
      - wrote tests 2-6
      - thanks to Byron Brummer who pointed out a pre-release bug in the EXISTS method
